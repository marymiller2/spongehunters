The Louisiana Freshwater Sponge Project was started by Dr. Mary Miller and a group
of interns through Baton Rouge Community College, in the Summer of 2019. The project was a follow up from the original survey that was conducted by [Dr. Michael Poirrier in 1968](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/217384297.pdf). 
<br>
**Aims of the Project:**
<br>
<br>
1. Bring awareness of freshwater sponges to the general public through [outreach](outreach.html) activities. 
<br>
2. Provide research experiences to [first and second year college students](student.html).
<br>
3. Continuously monitor the freshwater sponge population in Louisiana as environmental health indicators and to share those finding in scientific [journals](publications.html).
<br>
<br>
The project is now shared between two institutions:
<br>
<br>
[Baton Rouge Community College](https://www.mybrcc.edu/), still led by Dr. Miller, and 
[Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium](https://www.lumcon.edu/), led by Dr. Stephanie Archer. The two have continue to collaborate with Dr. Poirrier to identify sponges and answer questions related to these environmental health indicators.
