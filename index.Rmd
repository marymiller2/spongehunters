Welcome to the Louisiana Freshwater Sponge Hunters page! 
<br>
<br>
The Louisiana Freshwater Sponge Project was started by Dr. Mary Miller and a group
of interns, in the Summer of 2019. The project was a follow up from the original survey that was conducted by [Dr. Michael Poirrier in 1968](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/217384297.pdf). 
<br>
<br>
The project is now shared between two institutions:
<br>
<br>
[Baton Rouge Community College](www.mybrcc.edu), still led by Dr. Miller, and 
[Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium](www.lumcon.edu), led by Dr. Stephanie Archer. The two have continued to collaborate with Dr. Poirrier to identify sponges and answer
questions related to these environmental health indicators.

**Aims of the Project:**
<br>
<br>
1. Bring awareness of freshwater sponges to the general public through [outreach](Outreach.html) activities. 
<br>
2. Provide research experiences to [first and second year college students](student.html).
<br>
3. Continuously survey Louisiana water systems and share our finding in scientific 
  [journals](publications.rmd).
