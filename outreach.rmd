We are currently planning outreach activities that will occur on the Baton Rouge 
Community College campus in fall 2021.

Additionally, we will be recruiting science classes from high schools within the Baton Rouge and New Orleans area that would like to participate in ongoing site collections to continuously monitor locations of great sponge diversity in the Louisiana area.

If you have events that you would like us to attend to educate visitors about freshwater
sponges, or would like to participate in upcoming outreach activities, please contact Dr. Miller at millerm2@mybrcc.edu.
