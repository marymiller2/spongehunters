"I am the first computer science major to have received the amazing opportunity to be part of The Louisiana Freshwater Sponge Project! My responsibilities in the lab include webmaster, data management, and I also do fieldwork as well. My goals are to graduate with an Associate Degree in Computer Science from BRCC and pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science plus a minor in Biology at Southeastern Louisiana University."

"Being in the outdoors, sponge hunting, and research are some of my favorite things to do. At the end of December 2021, I will be graduating from BRCC and getting my Associate Degree in science. I will be continuing my education at FranU to get my Bachelor’s degree in Medical Laboratory Science, while continuing the Sponge adventures."

"My role on the Louisiana Freshwater Sponge Project is to analyze a variety of soil samples gathered from previous sponge hunting trips, in hopes of finding spicules. I will be graduating this semester with my Associate Degree in Biology, and will be applying to nursing school in hopes to attend in Fall 2022."
