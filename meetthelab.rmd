"I am the first computer science major to have received the amazing opportunity to be part of The Louisiana Freshwater Sponge Project! My responsibilities in the lab include webmaster, data management, and I also do fieldwork as well. My goals are to graduate with an Associate of Science in Computer Science degree from BRCC and pursue a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree with a concentration in data science plus a minor in biological sciences."

"I work in the lab mainly doing spicule prep and major in general science with a focus on biology. I have worked in entomology and currently as an equine professional; which has heavily influenced my interest in animal behavior and career choice of wildlife biology."

"I am currently majoring in natural resource ecology and management and my role in the Louisiana Freshwater Sponge Project is water analysis. After completing my Associates of Science Transfer degree, I hope to attend LSU to continue my education in wildlife ecology. A fun fact about me is that I have been a vegetarian for about 14 years now."
