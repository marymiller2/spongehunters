"I am the first computer science major to have received the amazing opportunity to be part of The Louisiana Freshwater Sponge Project! My responsibilities in the lab include webmaster, data management, and I also do fieldwork as well. My goals are to graduate with an associate's degree in computer science from BRCC and pursue a bachelor's degree in computer science with a concentration in data science plus a minor in biological sciences."
