Baton Rouge Community College engages students in freshwater sponge research through
a [Course-based undergraduate Research Experience](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6396/1417.6) during their 
second year biology lab. This course is designed for the students to develop critical thinking skills, molecular skills, increase scientific literacy, and allow them
to contribute to a larger pool of scientific knowledge. The course data has also 
shown to increase student self-efficacy.




BRCC students can also participate summer internships.
