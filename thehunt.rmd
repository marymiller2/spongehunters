In fall 2017, Dr. Miller was invited on a "sponge hunt" with a group of scientists through the [Community College Undergraduate Research Initiative](https://www.ccuri.us/) to collect sponges throughout the New England states. This led to a passion and the idea to implement freshwater sponge research at Baton Rouge Community College.

The Louisiana Freshwater Sponge survey began in the spring 2018 with a group of BRCC students led by Dr. Miller. This began an enthusiastic journey!

In summer 2019, the "hunt" was in full affect. Dr. Miller led a group of students on a state wide survey. This trip lasted 4 days, and covered 35 parishes! They would spend the summer creating a course curriculum that would be used by BRCC students and for outreach.
